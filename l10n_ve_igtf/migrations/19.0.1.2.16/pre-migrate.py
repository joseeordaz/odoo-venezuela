"""Pre-migration for l10n_ve_igtf 19.0.1.2.16: explicit field-by-field
report for retiring binaural_advance_payment / binaural_advance_payment_igtf
into the unified l10n_ve_igtf.

Per instruction: migrate data from binaural_advance_payment /
binaural_advance_payment_igtf into l10n_ve_igtf ONLY where l10n_ve_igtf
already declares the same field (same table, same column name -- the
data is already sitting there, nothing to move). Fields that have no
home in l10n_ve_igtf are NOT migrated: they are backed up (so the value
isn't lost outright) and then dropped when the old module is
uninstalled. All views belonging to these two modules are deleted, not
just left to whatever the module uninstall does implicitly.

Full field-by-field comparison (verified by reading both modules' models/
directly, not assumed):

binaural_advance_payment -> l10n_ve_igtf:
  account_move.is_advance_move                                    -> SAME COLUMN, exists in l10n_ve_igtf. No migration needed.
  account_move.origin_payment_advanced_payment_id                 -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.
  account_move.invoice_outstanding_credits_debits_widget_advance_payment -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.
  account_move.outstanding_credits_debits_widget_advance_payment  -> NOT in l10n_ve_igtf. Binary, NOT store=True (no DB column exists) -- nothing to migrate, no data to lose.
  account_move.cross_move_ids                                     -> NOT in l10n_ve_igtf. Many2many, v19-only (no v17 predecessor in this same module) -- nothing to migrate, table would be empty at migration time regardless.
  account_move_line.payment_id_advance                            -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.
  account_payment.is_advance_payment                               -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.
  account_payment.advanced_move_ids                                -> SAME relation, exists (One2many, not its own column). No migration needed.
  account_payment.amount_residual_from_payment                    -> NOT in l10n_ve_igtf. Float, real data possible. NOT migrated -- backed up below, then dropped.
  res_company/res_config_settings.advance_customer_account_id      -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.
  res_company/res_config_settings.advance_supplier_account_id      -> SAME COLUMN, exists. No migration needed.

binaural_advance_payment_igtf -> l10n_ve_igtf:
  account_move_line.invoice_advance_igtf_id                        -> NOT in l10n_ve_igtf. Many2one, real data possible. NOT migrated -- backed up below, then dropped.
  account_move.igtf_percentage                                     -> NOT in l10n_ve_igtf at the account.move level (l10n_ve_igtf only declares igtf_percentage on account.payment and res.company/res.config.settings, a different model). NOT migrated -- backed up below, then dropped.
  res_company/res_config_settings.advance_payment_igtf_journal_id  -> SAME COLUMN, exists in l10n_ve_igtf. No migration needed.
