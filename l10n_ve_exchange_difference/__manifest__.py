    'category': 'Accounting/Localizations',
    'summary': 'Document exchange-rate differences on customer invoices as real fiscal Debit/Credit Notes',
    'description': """
Venezuelan localization module that documents the exchange difference of
customer invoices as real fiscal Debit/Credit Notes, instead of the generic,
internal accounting entry Odoo creates by default.

How it works:

- Odoo's native reconciliation runs untouched -- its own exchange
  difference computation (`_prepare_exchange_difference_move_vals`) is
  intercepted for qualifying CUSTOMER invoice/note lines, and the exact
  amount it determined is redirected to a real Debit Note (gain, dedicated
  journal) or Credit Note (loss, same sales journal as the invoice) instead
  of Odoo's generic internal entry.
- The note is created and closed synchronously, at the same point in the
  reconciliation transaction where Odoo creates its own generic entry --
  linked to the source invoice and reconciled immediately against the
  residual.
- If the invoice-payment reconciliation that originated the note is broken --
  no matter how (the payments widget, or any other path that breaks the
  underlying reconciliation) -- the note (already posted, with a real
  sequence number) is reversed automatically, regardless of whether the
  feature toggle is still enabled at that point. It is never cancelled or
  deleted. Unreconciling the note directly is blocked.
- Only applies to CUSTOMER invoices/credit notes. Any other case (vendor
  bills, manual entries) follows Odoo's native behavior unmodified.

Configuration -- reconciliation fails with a clear error instead of leaving
an incomplete or misnumbered note, but WHEN that error can surface differs:

Validated when the feature is enabled and saved (`Settings > Binaural
Settings`, not the native Accounting settings page):

- Dedicated product (with an exempt tax) for the Debit/Credit Note line.
- Dedicated pricelist (in the company's own currency) for the Debit/Credit
  Note, required by `account_invoice_pricelist`.

Validated per journal, only at reconciliation time (there is no single
company-level setting that can guarantee every journal a customer invoice
might use is ready in advance):

- A sales journal with `Is Debit` enabled and its own dedicated sequence
  assigned, for Debit Notes -- a Debit Note is never numbered with the
  invoice journal's own sequence.
- The invoice's own sales journal needs its own dedicated Credit Note
  sequence (`Refund Sequence`) configured, for Credit Notes -- this is
  never auto-provisioned on save or on the fly: reconciliation fails with a
  clear error instead of silently renumbering a journal shared with normal
  business documents.
